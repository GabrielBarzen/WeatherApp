/* Achievement ideas
    - Snowman: have seen snow
    - Wet shoes: have had 5 consecutive days of rain
    - Dry spell: haven't got any rain for a full week
    - Death valley: have experienced 30 degrees celsius or warmer


    Logic:
    Collect stats array from localStorage
    Loop through array
    check if snow days > 0
