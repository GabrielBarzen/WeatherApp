## Motivation of choices
We decided to use the framwork Vue to build this application. We were standing between Vue, React and Angluar. We quickly excluded Angular due to the limited developer satisfaction alongside its decreasing relevance. 

We had a hard time deciding between React and Vue, but our final choice landed on Vue. The reasoning were that we wanted to learn a framework that we could use in our own personal project, where React seemed more suitable for larger scale projects. Another major deciding factor were that one of the group members was going to use Vue at their future workplace.

In the end, either choice would have been fine for this project, but we are happy with our choice of Vue.
